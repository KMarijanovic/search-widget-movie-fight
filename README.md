Search Widget (2021)

This is the final code for the Search Widget project while coding along and learning with Stephen Grider in "The Modern JS Bootcamp Course (2021) | Udemy" by Colt Steele & Stephen Grider.

Main goal of this project is Search Widget that is created to be reuseable and implemented with Bulma CSS framework.

The idea of this project is to compare two movies while fetching data from free API.

Main focus here is practicing JS while exploring Bulma and Font Awesome as extra free resources for future projects.

Explanation of the code (process making) is inside of every file in comments.

- Note: BoxOffice element (nominations) is not working while comparing two movies, because BoxOffice data is no longer available with free apiKey. The solution is made to style that element grey while doing comparisson.
